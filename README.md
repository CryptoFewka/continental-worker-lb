# Cloudflare Worker for Geographic Routing

This project is a simple Cloudflare Worker script that provides geographic routing for incoming requests based on the country of origin. It routes the requests to the closest server in the appropriate continent to minimize latency.

## Overview

This Cloudflare Worker uses the `CF-IPCountry` header to determine the country of origin of each incoming request. It then maps this country code to a continent using a predefined mapping, and routes the request to a server located in that continent.

The worker script includes a fallback mechanism that automatically routes the request to a backup server if the primary server does not respond within a specified timeout.

## Usage

This worker can be used in any Cloudflare-enabled web application to optimize the routing of requests based on geographic location.

To use this worker, follow these steps:

1. Copy the worker script from `worker.js`.
2. Navigate to the 'Workers' section in your Cloudflare dashboard.
3. Click 'Create a Worker'.
4. Paste the worker script in the provided script editor.
5. Click 'Save and Deploy' to deploy your worker.

## Customization

This worker script can be customized to suit your needs. Here are a few ways you can customize it:

- **Server Lists:** You can modify the lists of servers for each continent to include your own servers.
- **Country-Continent Mapping:** You can update the country-continent mapping to include or exclude certain countries, or to change the continent assigned to each country.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** You can adjust the timeout for the fallback mechanism, or modify the logic used to select the backup server.

## Continuous Deployment

This project can be set up for continuous deployment using GitHub. This means that any changes pushed to the GitHub repository would be automatically be deployed to the Cloudflare Worker. To set this up, follow the instructions provided in the Cloudflare dashboard.
